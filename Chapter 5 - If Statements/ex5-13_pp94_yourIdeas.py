"""
    I have a pretty decent list of some ideas I want to implement with python.
    I am currently working on a mac task bar app that gives out aurora
    notifications, but I wanted to work through this book first so I can make
    sure I build the app with best practice. That way I don't have too much
    work to go back and correct.
