4-15. Code Review: Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter
      and modify each one to comply with PEP 8:
      •	Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to
        insert four spaces every time you press tab, if you haven’t already
        done so (see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
      •	Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a
        vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
      •	Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files .

# Downloaded the Flake8 and python-autopep8 packages for Atom to handle this
# for me. Had already set up the guideline and tabs to spaces settings.
